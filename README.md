# 🐍 Snake Game — Python Turtle Project

This is a classic Snake Game made using Python's `turtle` module. The game includes a moving snake, randomly appearing food, a scoreboard, collision detection (with walls and itself), pause/resume functionality, and a custom pop-up box on game over!

### 📁 Files Included
- `main.py` — Main game loop and event handling
- `snake.py` — Snake class and movement logic
- `food.py` — Food generation, score, and game-over/pause display

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🐍 Smooth snake movement and direction control
- 🍏 Random food spawns with score tracking
- 🧱 Wall collision & self-collision detection
- 😎 Snake eyes (custom head look)
- ⏸️ Pause/Resume with spacebar
- ✅ ESC key exits the game
- 🔁 Retry/Quit pop-up on game over

---

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run `main.py` in your terminal or IDE:
   ```bash
   python main.py
## 💡 What I Learned

- Mastered the `turtle` module for graphics and animation
- Learned about class structures and used **superclasses**
- Handled real-time input events with `onkey()`
- Faced and solved the **biggest challenge**: giving the snake **custom eyes**
- Gained confidence in breaking a game into logical modules
- Took help from **ChatGPT** for ideas and debugging
